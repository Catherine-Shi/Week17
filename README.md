The model is built based on data from a Portugese banking institution. The data consists of a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Classification models are built to understand what features affect customers' behavior in deciding to subscribe to a term deposit or not. 

Four main models are used in the process including logistic regression, knn, decision tree and svm. Related tuning and hyperparameter adjustements are also used. Based on the resulting accuracy and time used to process each model, we recommend the bank to adopt knn method in classifying its future customers based on their banking information including age, gender, education, loan status etc.
